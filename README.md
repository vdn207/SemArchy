# SemArchy: Video segment retrieval engine

Video is composed of heterogeneous contents. Conventional video search engines retrieve complete
videos relevant to the search queries using the metadata attached to videos. However, relevant
content might be present only in a subsection of the video and the content of the videos are not
understood through the metadata. This work is concerned with extracting relevant video segments
by analysing the contents of the videos.
